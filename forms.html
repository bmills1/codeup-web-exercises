Below is an example of using the Request Inspector.
-->


<form method="POST" action="https://www.elformo.com/forms/159f5c8c-a78d-47b7-91a8-334abf20c87e

">
    <h1>Register With Us!</h1>
<!--
    Create text fields for email and password with appropriate placeholder values.
-->
    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
    <input id="email" type="email" name="email">
    <br>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input id="password" type="password" name="password">
    <br>
<!--
    Create a textarea named "bio". This is for the user to fill out a short description of themselves.
-->
    <label for="bio">Bio</label>
    <br>
    <textarea id="bio" name="bio" col="30" rows="10"></textarea>

<!--
    Create a "How did you hear about us" section that contains radio buttons. The values should be "billboard", "radio advertisement", "internet advertisement", and "other". Only one of the values should be allowed to be selected at a time.
-->

    <br>
    <h2>How did you hear about us?</h2>
    <section>
        billboard<input name="questionaire" type="radio" value="billboard">
        radio advertisement<input name="questionaire" type="radio" value="radio">
        internet advertisement<input name="questionaire" type="radio" value="internet">
        other<input name="questionaire" type="radio" value="other">
    </section>
    <br>
    <input type="submit">
    <!--What happens if the inputs are given different name attributes?
    Change these inputs so that multiple answers are allowed to be selected.
    Create a dropdown that asks the user what web browser they are using.

    If you change the inputs they will not correspond to the question associated with that attribute and the radio button would not be clickable in the changed selection.
    -->

    <!--

    Make sure all of your form elements have labels.
    Ensure that all of your form values are being submitted to the Request Inspector.
    Experiment with different attribute values:
    What do you notice when changing the form's request method from GET to POST?   I originally started with a POST request. The post request sent information to the server that was input. This method is not requesting information to be displayed back to the user. On the other hand, changing it to a GET request is asking for information to be retrieved from the server and displayed back to the user. Also, the information that was input is displayed in the web address bar of the browser, posing a security risk
    What happens if you leave off the name attribute on an input?
    The name value is the key that is being transmitted to the server. If it is left out the form would not know what information is being requested for the server.
    What happens if you leave off the id attribute on a form input?
    The input would still be transmitted as normal, but the id gives the name a unique identifier that makes styling easier later. Also, the text being clicked would not result in the cursor being placed into the coordinating box, because the label would no longer be attached to the input.
