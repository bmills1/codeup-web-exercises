    Experiment with different attribute values:
    What do you notice when changing the form's request method from GET to POST? I originally started with a POST request. The          post request sent information to the server that was input. This method is not requesting information to be displayed back to       the user. On the other hand, changing it to a GET request is asking for information to be retrieved from the server and             displayed back to the user. Also, the information that was input is displayed in the web address bar of the browser, posing a       security risk
    What happens if you leave off the name attribute on an input?
    The name value is the key that is being transmitted to the server. If it is left out the form would not know what information       is being requested for the server.
    What happens if you leave off the id attribute on a form input?
    The input would still be transmitted as normal, but the id gives the name a unique identifier that makes styling easier             later. Also, the text being clicked would not result in the cursor being placed into the coordinating box, because the label        would no longer be attached to the input.
